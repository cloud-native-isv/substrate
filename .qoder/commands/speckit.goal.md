## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Process `$ARGUMENTS` per the [User Input Protocol](.specify/shared/workflow/user-input-protocol.md). Treat as command parameters, not standalone instructions.

## Positioning

`/speckit.goal` is the **sole authoring entry** for project-level goal definitions. It owns create, view, modify, migrate, and coordinate. No skill, script, or other command may write into the goal archive.

A **Goal** is a project-level authored fact source. Its concept — composition, lifecycle, boundary against Requirement, criteria authority, singularity, and the team binding — is defined once in `.specify/shared/definitions/goal-definitions.md`. **Link to that document; never restate it here.** This command owns only the *operations*.

Deterministic rules (identity grammar, three-part structure, lifecycle table, change history, archive enumeration) live in `.specify/scripts/python/goal-utils.py`. Call the engine; do not re-derive its judgments in prose.

## Glossary

Consult `.specify/memory/glossary.md` and apply `.specify/shared/workflow/glossary.md`: map recorded homophone/confusable variants to canonical terms before acting, surfacing each correction. At wrap-up propose new project-specific terms (`origin=auto`, `status=proposed`) with user confirmation.

## Modes

Mode is inferred from `$ARGUMENTS` and **confirmed with the user before any write**. Ambiguous input resolves to `view`, which is read-only.

| Mode | Purpose | Writes |
|------|---------|--------|
| `create` | archive a new goal definition | `.specify/goal/<goal-slug>/goal.md` |
| `view` | list the archive, or show one goal | nothing |
| `modify` | change objective, criteria, or lifecycle state | the same definition file |
| `migrate` | derive a definition from a team's inline goal and switch that team to a reference | new `goal.md` + that `team.md` |
| `coordinate` | propose a territory re-division across teams sharing one goal | nothing until ratified, then each `team.md` |

## Outline

1. **Resolve context**: run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` for `REPO_ROOT`. The archive is `REPO_ROOT/.specify/goal/`.

2. **Determine the mode** from `$ARGUMENTS`; state it back to the user.

3. **Preview → confirm → execute.** Before any write, show: the mode, the target path, and the exact content to be written (or the diff for a modify). Proceed only on explicit confirmation. `view` skips the gate.

4. **Execute via the engine** — never hand-write a definition file:

   ```bash
   python3 .specify/scripts/python/goal-utils.py create <goal-slug> \
     --objective "<desired end outcome>" \
     --criterion "<verifiable condition>" --criterion "<...>" --json
   python3 .specify/scripts/python/goal-utils.py view   # → `list`
   python3 .specify/scripts/python/goal-utils.py validate <goal-slug>
   python3 .specify/scripts/python/goal-utils.py status <goal-slug> --set achieved
   python3 .specify/scripts/python/goal-utils.py criteria <goal-slug> --criterion "<new>"
   ```

   Exit codes: `0` ok · `2` input error (rejection) · `3` not found · `4` validation failed. A non-zero exit is a **verdict**: report it, never argue around it.

5. **Interview for `create`** — collect exactly three things, and nothing else. Ask them per the interview pattern (`.specify/shared/patterns/interview-pattern.md`): **open** questions carrying their context, no option menus and no recommended answers (the objective is the user's to state, not yours to propose), facts looked up rather than asked, each answer written through before the next round.
   - the **objective**: the desired end *outcome*. If the user describes steps, say so and ask for the outcome instead (the engine rejects task lists as GD-2).
   - **success criteria**: zero or more verifiable conditions. Zero is legal — the archive records `None provided.` and consumers declare the absence rather than inventing criteria.
   - the **identity**: a slug that is also the directory name. Reuse `goal_slug` semantics; do not invent a second identifier.

   If the objective bundles several objectives the engine rejects it as GD-3 — help the user split it into separate goals, each with its own directory and lifecycle.

6. **`migrate <team-slug>`**: read that team's inline goal, derive a definition whose objective and criteria are semantically equivalent, create it, then set the team's `goal_slug` to the new identity. **Never** delete the team's inline goal — retention is the user's choice, and migration is per-team and optional.

7. **`coordinate <goal-slug>`**: the mechanism detects overlap and **proposes** a re-division with its rationale. It writes nothing. On the user's ratification, write the agreed territory back into each affected `team.md` — never into the goal directory.

## Boundaries

- The definition is **authored**. No derived flow may write `goal.md`; the summary refresh writes only `<goal-slug>/summary/**`.
- The goal's object is **unrestricted** — the framework itself, codebase-wide convention convergence, runtime outcomes. Never reject a goal because no functional requirement in this project implements it.
- Criteria are **measured by degree**, not per-clause pass/fail. Never render a criterion as a binary checkbox.
- Criteria are **cross-feature** and disjoint from any requirements spec's `SC-xxx`. Never copy criteria in either direction.
- `requirements.md` carries no goal field and a goal never enumerates functional requirements. The two sit on different planes with no hierarchy.
- A team serves exactly one goal at a time.
- Terminal goals (`achieved` / `abandoned`) stay archived. Deletion is not a lifecycle transition.

## Feedback

At wrap-up, perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user) per `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`: gate on completion, reflect with ≥1 concrete optimization point, keep scope local, dedup by a stable `run_id`, then persist:

```bash
python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
  --unit-id "/speckit.goal" --unit-type command \
  --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
  --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
```

If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface one consolidated submission prompt; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`.

## Documentation

At the same wrap-up point, apply the docs-sync evaluation per `.specify/shared/workflow/docs-step.md` and conclude with exactly one of `需记录（目标文档 + 要点）` or `无需记录`. Never block wrap-up.

## Handoffs

**Before**: none — a goal may be archived at any time, with or without teams.

**After**: bind a team by declaring `goal_slug` in its `team.md` (see `/speckit.team`). Once two or more teams share a goal, run `coordinate` to keep their territories disjoint.
