## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Process `$ARGUMENTS` per the [User Input Protocol](.specify/shared/workflow/user-input-protocol.md). Detect input type and apply:
- **Background info** → integrate as context constraints
- **Task outline** → use as primary organizational structure
- **Additional task entries** → parse, standardize, merge into appropriate phases

If empty, generate a complete `tasks.md` from available design artifacts.

## Glossary

Consult the project glossary (`.specify/memory/glossary.md`, ambient via the Documentation Map) and apply the protocol in `.specify/shared/workflow/glossary.md`:

- **Before acting on the user input**, map any recorded homophone/confusable variant to its canonical term (correcting voice/dictated input); surface each correction so the user can override it, and defer to the user on ambiguous variants.
- **At wrap-up**, propose any new project-specific terms (`origin=auto`, `status=proposed`), excluding common words; run conflict detection and obtain explicit user confirmation before writing. User-authored entries are authoritative.

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse REQUIREMENTS_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from REQUIREMENTS_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), requirements.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Generate task list workflow**:
   - **Analyze $ARGUMENTS input type**: Determine if input contains background context, task outline, or additional task items
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load requirements.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - **Integrate $ARGUMENTS content**: 
     - For background info: Apply as contextual constraints in task generation
     - For task outlines: Use as primary organizational structure
     - For additional tasks: Parse, standardize, and merge into appropriate phases
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from requirements.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Validate DoD format**: Before writing the final file, verify that the `## Definition of Done` section uses ONLY the `- DoD-N:` prefix format. No line in this section may match `^\- \[[ xX~]\]` (checkbox syntax is reserved for task rows). If any DoD items were accidentally written with checkboxes, rewrite them using the `- DoD-N:` prefix.

6. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: 
- Design documents from REQUIREMENTS_DIR: {AVAILABLE_DOCS}
- User input analysis result: {ARGUMENTS_ANALYSIS_RESULT}
- Input type handling strategy: {INPUT_HANDLING_STRATEGY}

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context. When $ARGUMENTS contains additional task items, ensure they are properly integrated with correct formatting, sequential IDs, and appropriate story labels.

## Feature Integration

Apply [Feature Integration Protocol](.specify/shared/workflow/feature-integration.md). This command maintains status from planning phase. Additionally, **the tasks phase MUST review the Feature list** — task breakdown may expose new Features or invalidate old ones. Update `.specify/memory/features.md` and detail files synchronously if changes are discovered.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are Constitution-driven (NOT a fixed default)**: Before generating tasks, detect test-mandating principles **deterministically** (token-efficiency program-first — see `.specify/shared/guidelines/token-efficiency.md`): run `grep -nE 'MUST|MANDATORY|NON-NEGOTIABLE|Test-First|TDD|Contract-Driven' .specify/memory/constitution.md` and consume only the matched principle headings/lines — do NOT read the whole constitution into context for this keyword check.

- **Tests default ON** if any such principle exists, OR if the feature specification / `$ARGUMENTS` explicitly requests TDD. In ON mode you MUST emit test tasks (contract, unit, integration as applicable) per user story BEFORE the corresponding implementation tasks. If the constitution defines distinct testing layers (e.g. Layer-1 generator unit tests + Layer-2 build/smoke validation), emit tasks for EVERY layer it mandates.
- **Tests default OFF** only when no test-mandating principle is found AND the spec is silent on TDD.

At the top of the generated `tasks.md`, you MUST print a one-line banner declaring which mode was chosen and cite the constitution principle (or absence thereof) that drove the decision. Example:

```text
**Tests Mode**: ON (Constitution Principle IV "Test-First Development" is NON-NEGOTIABLE; Layer-1 unit + Layer-2 validation required)
```

or

```text
**Tests Mode**: OFF (constitution.md declares no test-mandating principle; spec did not request TDD)
```

**Template-only / doc-feature gate**: if the constitution (or plan.md's Constitution Check) carries a *template-only features* principle (e.g. a Principle VII-style rule that template/prompt/doc artifacts are governed by structural contract tests rather than runtime tests), cite THAT gate in the banner and emit **structural contract tests** (content/heading/mirror-parity assertions on the artifact) — not unit/integration tests, which have nothing to run against. Do not re-derive this from feature history each run.

### Environment Prerequisites (probe at generation time)

When any generated task depends on an external environment (docker daemon, network-pullable images, a live cluster, special hardware):

1. **Probe availability now**: check each required environment during task generation (e.g. `docker info`, a registry pull check) instead of letting `/speckit.implement` discover the gap mid-run.
2. **Emit a per-phase prerequisites block**: each affected phase lists its environment prerequisites explicitly so a runner can skip or defer the phase as a unit.
3. **Pre-validate named targets**: any concrete build/smoke target named in a task MUST have a locally satisfiable dependency chain (base images pullable, toolchain present). If unsatisfiable, either substitute a satisfiable target up front or pre-flag the task `[~]`-eligible in Notes with the substitution guidance.

### Pin Hygiene (test-authoring rule)

Tasks that author or modify tests MUST follow pin-hygiene so the project's own next increment does not break its own contracts:

1. **Version pins use floor semantics**: assert `parsed >= (MAJOR, MINOR)`, never `startswith("X.Y")` — a later legitimate bump must not fail an unrelated contract.
2. **Surface-file lists must be real**: every file path listed in a test fixture/surface list MUST be existence-checked at authoring time (or the list derived from the tree); a phantom entry turns the whole test into a permanent FileNotFoundError.
3. **Counts are contracts, not conveniences**: hard-code a count only when the count itself is the contract (then update it in the same task that changes the population); otherwise derive it with `len(...)` from a glob.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from requirements.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path
6. **[blockedBy: Txxx,Tyyy] tag**: REQUIRED whenever a task depends on specific earlier tasks (derived from plan/data-model/contract dependencies). Use the tag, not prose ("depends on T012") — `/speckit.implement` orders execution topologically from these tags and refuses to start a task whose blockers are not `[X]`. Omit the tag when only phase order applies.

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (requirements.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase
   - Prefer one test file per contract document rather than per story: when multiple stories append to a single shared test file, [P] parallel markers become invalid and stories serialize on that file

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Asset-migration phase shape (porting/vendoring an external code subset)**: when a spec copies an external codebase subset in as a hosted asset, split the copy from its acceptance: the **physical copy + static dependency-closure check** is Foundational (Phase 2 — it blocks everything), while **governance artifacts** (provenance ledger, license, ported regression tests, mirrors) belong to the user story that owns the asset. Two standard acceptance actions for the copy task: (1) grep-assert every import resolves to the runtime's builtins or inside the subset; (2) **actually resolve all entry modules with the runtime** (e.g. `node -e "await import(...)"` per entry) — checklist-driven copying misses transitive dependencies that only real module resolution exposes.

**Doc-feature phase shape (template-only / documentation / prompt-framework specs)**: when the spec's deliverables are templates, docs, prompts, or skills rather than runtime code, "Models → Services → Endpoints" does not apply — do not force it. Switch the within-story order to the doc-feature taxonomy:
1. **author-section** — write/edit the template or document section itself
2. **mirror-parity** — every row of plan.md's *Mirror Obligations* table MUST be covered by an explicit write task and an explicit verify task: rows that share one fan-out command (e.g. a single `sync-mirrors.py --write`) MAY share the write task (one per phase, not one per row), but each verify task MUST enumerate the rows it covers (`diff -q` for mirrors; grep-for-the-edit for regenerated per-tool copies). Mirror pairs are first-class tasks, never implicit side-effects of the authoring task.
3. **render-verify** — actually render/execute the artifact (render the diagram, run the template through its consumer) and inspect the output
4. **refresh-verify** — re-run the artifact's refresh/regeneration path to confirm repeatability
The app-shaped examples in the tasks template are illustrative, not mandatory; pick the taxonomy that matches the spec's actual deliverables.

## Feedback

At wrap-up (the same lifecycle point where this command prompts for a Git commit), perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user), following the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`:

1. **Gate on qualification & completion.** Only proceed if this command reached its wrap-up stage. Skip trivial/no-op runs; for an aborted run use the abort/partial rule below.
2. **Reflect (no user input).** Review this run against `/speckit.tasks`'s declared purpose and produce a short review plus ≥1 concrete, command-specific optimization point. If the run was clean, use exactly: `No significant optimization points identified this run.`
3. **Scope guard.** Keep strictly to this command's operation; do NOT produce a global/whole-project assessment (that is `/speckit.review`'s job). Entries are `scope: local`.
4. **Dedup guard.** Use a stable `run_id` (e.g. the feature key + a run timestamp); if a nested skill/command already recorded feedback for this same `(unit_id, run_id)`, the engine no-ops.
5. **Persist** via the engine:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
     --unit-id "/speckit.tasks" --unit-type command \
     --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
     --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
   ```
   Probe attribution: the engine resolves the unit to its probe object automatically — the entry inherits kind/slice from the probe registry. External custom units record via `--unit-id custom:<owner>/<name> --unit-type custom-unit`; their entries stay host-project-local and never enter upstream packages.
6. **Consolidated submission prompt.** If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface a single consolidated prompt inviting the user to submit collected feedback to the Spec Kit developers; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`. Below threshold, do not prompt.

**Abort / partial-run rule.** If the run failed before wrap-up, either skip recording or record with `--partial` and a `## Review` beginning `**Partial run** — `.

## Documentation

At the same wrap-up point as the Feedback step, apply the docs-sync evaluation per the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/docs-step.md`: assess whether information produced by this run (new capabilities, key decisions, structural changes) needs to be recorded into the project documentation space, and conclude with exactly one of `需记录（目标文档 + 要点）` or `无需记录`. Never block wrap-up; incremental judgment only (no full reconcile sweep); when a move/archive-level change is needed, recommend running `/speckit.docs` instead of executing it here.

## Handoffs

**Before running this command**:

- Run `/speckit.plan` to produce a plan and design artifacts.

**After running this command**:

- Optionally run `/speckit.analyze` to check cross-artifact consistency before implementation.
- Optionally run `/speckit.checklist` to create quality gates.
- Then run `/speckit.implement` to execute the tasks phase-by-phase.
