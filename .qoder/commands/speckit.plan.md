## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** analyze the user input in `$ARGUMENTS`, infer the user's intent, and use that intent to supplement missing context and guide the planning process.

The user input may include:

1. Special requests that require extra care or custom handling during the planning workflow.
2. Supplemental information that provides additional context or reference material.
3. Specific planning constraints, architectural preferences, or technical requirements that go beyond the default scope described in this document.

When processing the user input:

1. You **MUST** treat `$ARGUMENTS` as parameters for the current command.
2. Do **NOT** treat the input as a standalone instruction that overrides or replaces the command workflow.
3. If the input contains clear ambiguity, confusion, or likely misspellings that materially affect interpretation, stop and ask the user to rephrase the request with clearer wording. Provide brief guidance when possible.

## Glossary

Consult the project glossary (`.specify/memory/glossary.md`, ambient via the Documentation Map) and apply the protocol in `.specify/shared/workflow/glossary.md`:

- **Before acting on the user input**, map any recorded homophone/confusable variant to its canonical term (correcting voice/dictated input); surface each correction so the user can override it, and defer to the user on ambiguous variants.
- **At wrap-up**, propose any new project-specific terms (`origin=auto`, `status=proposed`), excluding common words; run conflict detection and obtain explicit user confirmation before writing. User-authored entries are authoritative.

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Analyze and process user input**: 
   - Read `$ARGUMENTS` content
   - Determine if it contains background information, planning outline, or specific constraints
   - Apply appropriate processing strategy based on content type
   - **Spec-restructure first**: if `$ARGUMENTS` expands or changes the requirement scope, do NOT plan against the stale spec — first restructure `requirements.md` (new/changed stories, FRs, success criteria) and re-validate its checklist, and only then fill the plan template. Plan artifacts are only trustworthy when the spec restructure has already landed. When MULTIPLE directives arrive across the run, batch them: integrate all into requirements.md and re-validate the checklist once, then fill the plan — do not interleave spec edits with plan filling. Record each directive verbatim under `## Clarifications` (append-only).

3. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and processed `$ARGUMENTS` context. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).
   - Check if `SPECS_DIR/research.md` exists. If so, read it.
   - **Crucial**: You MUST also read and analyze the project's **existing documentation** (`README.md`, `docs/`) and **feature memory** (`.specify/memory/`) to ensure the plan aligns with the system's architecture and evolution.

4. **Implement plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - **Fill the template in place**: replace every `[PLACEHOLDER]` token in the copied IMPL_PLAN. Do **NOT** append a second copy of the template below your filled content (a duplicated `# Implementation Plan:` block with leftover placeholder tokens is a defect).
   - Stamp the header line `**Requirement → Feature**: <REQUIREMENTS_KEY> → Feature <FEATURE_ID> <FEATURE_NAME>` so the requirement key and the bound feature ID are never confused, and reference the feature as `Feature <ID>` (never a bare number) throughout.
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
     - Incorporate relevant background information from `$ARGUMENTS`
     - Incorporate findings from `research.md` if available
   - Fill Constitution Check section by **dynamically deriving** the principle table from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:
     1. Parse every heading matching `### <numeral>. <name>` (Roman or Arabic) in the order they appear.
     2. Preserve any `(NON-NEGOTIABLE)` / `(MANDATORY)` annotation verbatim in the row label.
     3. Emit one row in the Constitution Check table per principle — DO NOT use a hard-coded list, and DO NOT inherit stale principles left over from a previous spec's plan.md.
     4. Mark each row Pass / Fail / Partial based on the design artefacts (`requirements.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `tasks.md`).
     5. Any Fail or Partial row MUST have a matching entry under Complexity Tracking with justification.
     - Include any additional constraints from `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a planning outline:
     - Integrate the outline structure into the plan template
     - Ensure all required sections are properly filled
   - Phase 0: Resolve clarifications (refer to `research.md` or conduct analysis)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, feature-ref.md
     - **Summarize after, not before**: any Phase 1 summary written into plan.md (entity counts, contract counts, artifact lists) MUST be filled in AFTER the artifacts land on disk — pre-written counts routinely drift from the actual output and force a correction pass.
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

5. **Plan integrity gate + stop and report**: Before finishing, verify the filled IMPL_PLAN contains (a) **no** residual `[UPPER_SNAKE_CASE]` placeholder tokens, (b) **exactly one** top-level `# Implementation Plan:` heading (no duplicated template body appended), and (c) the `**Requirement → Feature**` stamp. Fix the file if any check fails. Then report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Feature Integration

The `/speckit.plan` command automatically integrates with the feature tracking system:

- If a `.specify/memory/features.md` file exists, the command will:
  - Detect the current feature directory (format: `.specify/specs/[REQUIREMENTS_KEY]/`)
  - Extract the feature ID from the directory name
  - Update the corresponding feature entry in `.specify/memory/features.md`:
    - **Bound-but-unregistered Feature**: if the spec's `Related Feature` names a Feature ID that has NO row yet in `features.md` (e.g. the binding was decided at `/speckit.clarify` but never registered), first CREATE the row and the `.specify/memory/features/<ID>.md` detail from `.specify/templates/feature-details-template.md` — then advance status. Do not leave the create-vs-advance branch implicit or skip registration because the ID is already written into the spec.
    - Advance status `Draft → Planned` per the canonical state machine in `.specify/templates/feature-details-template.md` § "Canonical Status State Machine". `/speckit.plan` MUST NOT land status `Implemented` — that transition is owned by `/speckit.implement`.
    - Keep the specification path unchanged
    - Update the "Last Updated" date
  - Automatically stage the changes to `.specify/memory/features.md` for git commit

In addition, **the plan phase MUST review the Feature list**:

- Check whether this plan introduces new Features or deprecates/merges existing Features.
- Ensure functional/non-functional Feature classification remains consistent.
- If there are changes, the following must be updated synchronously:
   - `.specify/memory/features/<ID>.md`
   - `.specify/memory/features.md`
- Record the "key changes / notes" corresponding to this plan in the Feature detail.

This integration ensures that all feature planning activities are properly tracked and linked to their corresponding entries in the project's feature index.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Research Review & Context

1. **Information Gathering** (summary-first — see `.specify/shared/guidelines/token-efficiency.md`):
   - **Project Docs**: consult `README.md` and pull `docs/` content as targeted excerpts for the areas this plan touches — do NOT read all files in `docs/` wholesale.
   - **Feature Memory**: project the feature index with `grep -E '^\| [0-9]{3}' .specify/memory/features.md` (ID/name/status rows) and read ONLY the detail file(s) of the bound/related Feature(s) under `.specify/memory/features/` — do NOT read the whole directory; escalate per the discipline doc's ladder when a row genuinely needs more depth.
   - **Codebase exploration pass**: before filling the template, run a dedicated exploration pass (use an Explore subagent when available) over the code the plan will touch — touchpoints, existing precedents, and downstream consumers. Use the findings to confirm or refute the spec's documented assumptions in one round rather than discovering them mid-design.
   - **Research Check**: Check if `research.md` exists in the local directory.
     - **If yes**: Read and analyze its contents. Use the Decisions and Rationale to resolve "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items in the Technical Context.
     - **If no**: Perform sufficient analysis of project docs and memory to populate the Technical Context. If significant unknowns remain, ERROR and instruct the user to run `/speckit.research`.

2. **Refine Technical Context**:
   - Update the "Technical Context" section in the plan based on the gathered info and any `$ARGUMENTS`.
   - Ensure all key technical decisions (language, framework, storage, API style) are explicitly stated.
   - **Underdetermined design → interview, never fabricate**: when a key decision is not answerable from the spec, `research.md`, or the codebase because it is a **user preference or trade-off acceptance**, run the interview pattern (`.specify/shared/patterns/interview-pattern.md`) over the plan — ask the settled-prerequisite decisions in one round with recommended answers, write each answer into Technical Context before asking the next round. For a wide or deeply branching design space, hand off to `/speckit.interview` with `plan.md` as the target artifact instead of running an ad-hoc loop here. Silently inventing a design the user never chose is the failure this prevents.

**Output**: Updated IMPL_PLAN with technical context filled.

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** Technical Context defined and unknowns resolved.

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Record feature binding** → `feature-ref.md`: the bound Feature ID/name and how this plan maps to it (see the plan template's Project Structure).

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, feature-ref.md (records the bound Feature ID/name and how this plan maps to it — see the plan template's Project Structure)

### Post-Generation Quality Gate: Contract Artifact Cleanup

After generating all Phase 1 artifacts (especially contract documents under `contracts/`), perform a mandatory review pass:

1. Scan each generated contract artifact for **internal deliberation markers** — phrases that indicate stream-of-consciousness reasoning leaked into the specification:
   - "Wait —", "Actually,", "On second thought", "Let me reconsider", "re-reading:", "Hmm,", "I think", "I realize", "To be clear:", "For the avoidance of doubt" (when followed by reasoning rather than a declarative statement)
2. For each instance found, **rewrite as a declarative statement**. Contract documents must read as specifications, not conversation transcripts. The reader should see conclusions, not the path to them.
3. Verify each contract artifact contains only:
   - Declarative interface definitions (inputs, outputs, constraints)
   - Normative rules (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD)
   - Concrete examples or schemas
   - No first-person reasoning, no self-correction prose, no exploratory narration
4. **Execution-verify emitted command examples**: every executable CLI example written into `quickstart.md` or `contracts/` MUST be either (a) executed once against the real tool during this phase, or (b) pinned by a contract test asserting its validity. Examples written from intent instead of code routinely drift from actual validators (flags, ID formats, argument grammars) and ship as broken documentation.

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

## Feedback

At wrap-up (the same lifecycle point where this command prompts for a Git commit), perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user), following the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`:

1. **Gate on qualification & completion.** Only proceed if this command reached its wrap-up stage. Skip trivial/no-op runs; for an aborted run use the abort/partial rule below.
2. **Reflect (no user input).** Review this run against `/speckit.plan`'s declared purpose and produce a short review plus ≥1 concrete, command-specific optimization point. If the run was clean, use exactly: `No significant optimization points identified this run.`
3. **Scope guard.** Keep strictly to this command's operation; do NOT produce a global/whole-project assessment (that is `/speckit.review`'s job). Entries are `scope: local`.
4. **Dedup guard.** Use a stable `run_id` (e.g. the feature key + a run timestamp); if a nested skill/command already recorded feedback for this same `(unit_id, run_id)`, the engine no-ops.
5. **Persist** via the engine:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
     --unit-id "/speckit.plan" --unit-type command \
     --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
     --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
   ```
   Probe attribution: the engine resolves the unit to its probe object automatically — the entry inherits kind/slice from the probe registry. External custom units record via `--unit-id custom:<owner>/<name> --unit-type custom-unit`; their entries stay host-project-local and never enter upstream packages.
6. **Consolidated submission prompt.** If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface a single consolidated prompt inviting the user to submit collected feedback to the Spec Kit developers; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`. Below threshold, do not prompt.

**Abort / partial-run rule.** If the run failed before wrap-up, either skip recording or record with `--partial` and a `## Review` beginning `**Partial run** — `.

## Documentation

At the same wrap-up point as the Feedback step, apply the docs-sync evaluation per the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/docs-step.md`: assess whether information produced by this run (new capabilities, key decisions, structural changes) needs to be recorded into the project documentation space, and conclude with exactly one of `需记录（目标文档 + 要点）` or `无需记录`. Never block wrap-up; incremental judgment only (no full reconcile sweep); when a move/archive-level change is needed, recommend running `/speckit.docs` instead of executing it here.

## Handoffs

**Before running this command**:

- Ensure `/speckit.requirements` has produced a requirements specification.
- If `requirements.md` contains any `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`, run `/speckit.clarify` first.

**After running this command**:

- Typically run `/speckit.tasks` to decompose the plan into an executable task list.
- Optionally run `/speckit.checklist` to introduce domain-specific quality gates before implementation.
