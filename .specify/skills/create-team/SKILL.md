# create-team

## Goal

Create and run an **agent team**: organize multiple Agents into a **collaborative structure** (parallel dispatch, serial chain, self-iterating iteration loop, or long-lived continuous operating loop), persist it as a reusable `.specify/teams/<slug>/team.md`, and **execute** it behind a preview→confirm gate. This skill owns both **defining** a team and **running** it, and is the single source of truth for the multi-agent Conceptual Model (see `references/conceptual-model.md`).

## Conceptual Model

The multi-agent Conceptual Model (Role × Stage × Type + Team/Loop, the Team Supervisor Meta role, and the static/dynamic structure split) is defined authoritatively in `references/conceptual-model.md`. Read it before defining or running a team; do not re-define it elsewhere.

The capacity vs. responsibility boundary — which template set defines an agent's capacity and which defines its team-scoped responsibility — is `references/capacity-vs-responsibility.md`.

The **goal** concept is defined authoritatively in `references/goal.md`. When a goal's theme is **optimization**, classify it per `references/optimization-goals.md`.

## Team Definition & Persistence (create mode)

Produce a team from a user **goal** and persist it as `.specify/teams/<slug>/team.md`. Establish the goal first, then derive both structures from it. Full procedure, schema, and persistence rules: [`references/create-mode.md`](references/create-mode.md).

1. **Establish the goal** — extract/confirm a verifiable goal from `$ARGUMENTS`/context.
2. **Match presets** — run `${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/match-team-preset.py --goal "<text>"` and act on its `confidence`.
3. **Select the pattern** — derive from the goal via the decision tree in [`references/patterns.md`](references/patterns.md).
4. **Build the roster** — a Role × Stage × Type matrix; judge `Type` by operating object (`references/conceptual-model.md`).
5. **Build the pattern config** — parallelism/territories, DAG/blockedBy, iteration thresholds, or continuous operating config.
6. **Confirm and persist** — present goal + roster + pattern, then write `team.md`.

`goal_slug` identifies the **goal**, not the team slug; it is a different axis from `slug` (the team's identity). See `references/goal.md` and `references/summary-mapping.md`.

## Execution (run mode)

`/speckit.team run <slug>` loads a persisted team and executes it behind the mandatory **preview → confirm → execute** gate. Full run discipline and shared protocols: [`references/execution-guide.md`](references/execution-guide.md).

1. **Load** the team from `.specify/teams/<slug>/team.md`.
2. **Restate the Goal** so execution is judged against it.
3. **Render Static Structure** — roster as a Role × Stage × Type matrix.
4. **Render Dynamic Structure** — pattern, settings, and execution flow.
5. **Confirmation gate** — present goal + structures and require explicit confirmation before orchestrating per pattern.
6. **Write the run report** — after every run, write a dated report to `.specify/teams/<slug>/runs/` per the Report contract below.

## Run Workspace, Reports & Output Discipline

Keep four file classes strictly separated: team definition, run reports, deliverables, and run intermediates. Token efficiency (see `.specify/shared/guidelines/token-efficiency.md`): agent prompts and handoffs carry digests/paths, never whole machine-managed data files. Full layout and protocols: [`references/execution-guide.md`](references/execution-guide.md).

### Report contract

After **every** run, write `.specify/teams/<slug>/runs/<UTC-timestamp>-report.md`:

```markdown
# Team Run Report: <name>
- **Team**: <slug> · **Goal**: <goal> · **Pattern**: <pattern> · **Outcome**: <outcome>
## Result Summary ## Deliverables ## Execution Detail ## Run Workspace ## Summary
Summary: produced | skipped(cadence) | skipped(budget) | declined(no-material); Overlap: none | contested(<n>) | undecidable(<team,…>)
First activation: declare the summary mechanism has activated and the cadence now in force (首次激活需声明).
```

## Pattern Selection (Decision Tree)

Select from four collaboration patterns, each with a distinct priority: **parallel** = 效率优先, **serial** = 质量优先, **iteration** = 目标收敛, **continuous** = 长期运营. The goal decides which fits. Decision tree and detailed pattern guides: [`references/patterns.md`](references/patterns.md).

---

## § Parallel Dispatch Pattern

**Priority: 效率优先 (throughput-first).** Dispatch multiple independent agents concurrently; correctness rests on conflict-free territories. Refresh the goal summary after cross-verification and Result Aggregation complete. Details: [`references/patterns.md § Parallel`](references/patterns.md#parallel-dispatch-pattern).

---

## § Serial Chain Pattern

**Priority: 质量优先 (quality-first).** Orchestrate agents in a DAG-based pipeline; a simple verification guards every handoff. Refresh the goal summary after each stage handoff verification passes. Details: [`references/patterns.md § Serial`](references/patterns.md#serial-chain-pattern).

---

## § Iteration Pattern

**Priority: 目标收敛 (converge to the goal).** A Team Supervisor (Meta) dispatches Workers, scores output, and iterates until threshold or cap. Refresh the goal summary after each generation's DECIDE phase completes. Details: [`references/patterns.md § Iteration`](references/patterns.md#iteration-pattern).

---

## § Continuous Operating Loop Pattern

**Priority: 长期运营 (operate the team long-term).** A long-lived loop that runs on a cadence; full operating discipline is in `references/operating-loops.md`. One `run` executes exactly one cycle.

### Per-Cycle Loop

1. READ `constraints.md` + budget + kill-switch
2. BUDGET check spend
3. TRIAGE discover & prioritize source work
4. ACT per maturity (L1 report-only; L2+ minimal change)
5. VERIFY independent verifier (L2+)
6. SCORE against quality dimensions
7. CRITIQUE append Post-Run Critique
8. REPORT write `runs/<ts>-report.md`
9. SUMMARIZE refresh the goal summary when the gates allow

---

## Summary Refresh (all patterns)

Every run refreshes a **goal-level summary** by driving `summarize-project` non-interactively (`--load`). Concept mapping and provenance rules live in `references/summary-mapping.md`.

### Trigger boundaries

| Pattern | Boundary |
|---------|----------|
| `continuous` | end of every Nth cycle — phase 9 SUMMARIZE, after REPORT |
| `iteration` | after each generation's DECIDE phase |
| `serial` | after each stage handoff verification passes |
| `parallel` | after cross-verification and Result Aggregation complete |
| all | **terminal summary** on goal met / converged / halt / manual stop (unless budget already exceeded) |

### Gate order (hard sequence)

Evaluate in order; the first blocking gate determines the recorded status. **Budget outranks cadence**; the summary is the **first step dropped** under budget pressure; two boundaries in rapid succession **coalesce** into one refresh.

1. **Budget** — at report-only tier or kill-switch set → skip, record `skipped(budget)`.
2. **Cadence** — not at an Nth boundary → skip, record `skipped(cadence)`.
3. **Material** — no item ledger and no run reports in the goal → decline, record `declined(no-material)`.
4. **Overlap detection** — detect write-scope overlap across teams sharing this `goal_slug`; record contested areas; do not rewrite any `team.md`.
5. Otherwise → refresh, record `produced`.

### Status line (mandatory in every run report)

```
Summary: produced | skipped(cadence) | skipped(budget) | declined(no-material)
Overlap: none | contested(<n>) | undecidable(<team,…>)
```

Exactly one status MUST appear. `produced` names the delivery directory; `skipped(budget)` names the blocking tier; `declined(no-material)` MUST NOT appear alongside any chart.

### Enablement

`config.summary` is opt-out: a team without the block is **still ENABLED** at the pattern's default cadence. The `continuous` default is every 5th cycle — **never every cycle**. Bounded patterns default to every boundary. Invoke the refresh non-interactively and record that fact in the report metadata.

## Shared Protocols

All patterns share file-path-only handoffs, progress tracking, structured result manifests from sub-agents, and model selection guidance. Details: [`references/execution-guide.md`](references/execution-guide.md).

## Hard Constraints

- **Territory validation MUST pass** before parallel dispatch
- **DAG validation (no cycles)** before serial chain starts; a **simple per-handoff verification** guards every serial step
- **Max iterations MUST be set** for iteration loops (default: 5, max: 10)
- **Continuous loops MUST start at maturity L1**, read `constraints.md` + budget + kill-switch at cycle start, honor the budget circuit-breaker (80% → report-only, 100%/kill-switch → halt), and use an **independent verifier** (default REJECT) at L2+ — see `references/operating-loops.md`
- **File-path-only handoff** — never paste content between agents
- **Context isolation** — each agent invocation is a fresh subagent; the continuous **verifier MUST be a separate sub-agent** from the implementer
- **Idempotent execution** — stages/iterations/cycles can be re-run safely
- **Run intermediates confined** to `.specify/teams/.work/<slug>/` (git-ignored); only declared final deliverables (standard output) persist to real target paths — never the team directory. Every team additionally keeps the tracked item ledger `items.jsonl`, and continuous teams also keep tracked `constraints.md` / `STATE.md` / `run-log.jsonl`, in the team directory. The summary delivery directory is **not** in the team directory — it belongs to the goal index `.specify/goal/<goal-slug>/summary/`
- **Every run writes a dated report** to `.specify/teams/<slug>/runs/<UTC-timestamp>-report.md` per the Report contract

## Agent-Specific Configuration

### Step 1: Identify Executing Agent

| Agent | Detection Signals |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Tools include `Agent`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Read`; `.claude/` directory exists |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Running in VS Code Copilot Chat context |
| **Qoder CLI** | `.qoder/` directory exists; `AGENTS.md` instructions loaded |
| **opencode** | `.opencode/` directory exists |

### Step 2: Load Agent-Specific Guidance

Check if a guide exists at:

```
${SKILL_HOME}/references/<agent-slug>-guide.md
```

If the guide exists, apply agent-specific tool mappings for orchestration (e.g., Claude Code uses `Agent` tool, Copilot uses `@workspace` delegation).

### Step 3: Capture Execution Feedback

If you encounter an agent-specific obstacle, generate feedback at:

```
.specify/memory/feedback/create-team-<agent-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>.md
```

```markdown
# Agent Execution Feedback

**Source**: create-team
**Agent**: <agent-slug>
**Timestamp**: <ISO-8601>
**Outcome**: <success | success-with-workaround | partial-failure | full-failure>

## Obstacle
[Description of the agent-specific issue encountered]

## Workaround Applied
[What was done to work around the issue, if anything]

## Suggested Improvement
[Specific change to the skill or reference document that would prevent this issue]
```

Only generate feedback when a genuine agent-specific obstacle was encountered.

## Feedback

**Runtime-mode gate.** If `${SKILL_WORKDIR}/.specify/` does not exist, this skill is
running in standalone mode (a non–Spec Kit deployment, e.g. a global agent skills
directory) — skip this entire Feedback step: no engine call, no feedback entry.

At the end of a substantial run of this skill, perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user), following the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`:

1. **Gate on qualification & completion.** Only proceed if this run reached a meaningful wrap-up. Skip trivial/no-op runs; for an aborted run use the abort/partial rule below.
2. **Reflect (no user input).** Review this run against this skill's declared purpose and produce a short review plus ≥1 concrete, skill-specific optimization point. If the run was clean, use exactly: `No significant optimization points identified this run.`
3. **Scope guard.** Keep strictly to this skill's operation; do NOT produce a global/whole-project assessment (that is `/speckit.review`'s job). Entries are `scope: local`.
4. **Dedup guard.** Use a stable `run_id`; if a parent flow already recorded feedback for this same `(unit_id, run_id)`, the engine no-ops.
5. **Persist** via the engine:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
     --unit-id "skill:create-team" --unit-type skill \
     --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
     --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
   ```
6. **Consolidated submission prompt.** If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface a single consolidated prompt inviting the user to submit collected feedback to the Spec Kit developers; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`. Below threshold, do not prompt.

**Abort / partial-run rule.** If the run failed before wrap-up, either skip recording or record with `--partial` and a `## Review` beginning `**Partial run** — `.
