name: memory-recall
description: Retrieve relevant prior memory before or during a Spec Kit task, using a lightweight local file index (no vectors). Searches short-term working notes in .specify/memory/session/ and long-term knowledge in .specify/memory/knowledge/ by keyword, tag, source, feature, and date, then injects the most relevant entries into context. Pairs with memory-record. Triggers include "回忆", "查找记忆", "recall memory", "what do we know about", "prior decisions".

# memory-recall

## Overview
Search the project memory store and surface the most relevant entries so the current Spec Kit task can build on past decisions, preferences, and working state. This is the *retrieval* half of the memory system; `memory-record` is the capture half. Retrieval uses a plain local JSON index and keyword/tag scoring — there is no vector store.

## When to use
- At the start of a `/speckit.*` command or skill run, to load relevant context before acting.
- Mid-task, when you need prior decisions or conventions on a specific subject.
- When the user asks what is already known/decided about a topic.

## Workflow
1. Derive a compact query from the task: key terms, the feature key (if any), and useful tags.
2. Choose a scope:
   - `session` — recent working context only.
   - `knowledge` — durable, cross-session knowledge only.
   - `all` — both (default when unsure).
3. Run the shared engine from the project root:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR}/.specify/scripts/python/memory-utils.py" \
     --action recall \
     --scope <session|knowledge|all> \
     --query "<key terms>" \
     --tags "<optional,tags>" \
     --feature "<optional-feature-key>" \
     --since "<optional YYYY-MM-DD>" \
     --limit 5
   ```
   Use `--format json` when you need to parse results programmatically; the default text output is human-readable.
4. Read the returned entry paths for full content when a summary is not enough, then fold the relevant points into your working context.
5. If nothing relevant is found, proceed without memory and rely on the current spec/plan.

## Related actions
- `--action list --scope <session|knowledge|all> --limit N` — browse the most recent entries without a query.
- `--action prune --scope session --max-entries N` / `--max-age-days D` — keep short-term memory bounded.
- `--action reindex --scope all` — rebuild `index.json` from files if an index is lost or stale.

## Path Conventions
- Engine (shared project script): `${SKILL_WORKDIR}/.specify/scripts/python/memory-utils.py`.
- Memory store (read from): `${SKILL_WORKDIR}/.specify/memory/session/` and `${SKILL_WORKDIR}/.specify/memory/knowledge/`.

## Feedback

**Runtime-mode gate.** If `${SKILL_WORKDIR}/.specify/` does not exist, this skill is
running in standalone mode (a non–Spec Kit deployment, e.g. a global agent skills
directory) — skip this entire Feedback step: no engine call, no feedback entry.

At the end of a substantial run of this skill, perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user), following the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`:

1. **Gate on qualification & completion.** Only proceed if this run reached a meaningful wrap-up. Skip trivial/no-op runs; for an aborted run use the abort/partial rule below.
2. **Reflect (no user input).** Review this run against this skill's declared purpose and produce a short review plus ≥1 concrete, skill-specific optimization point. If the run was clean, use exactly: `No significant optimization points identified this run.`
3. **Scope guard.** Keep strictly to this skill's operation; do NOT produce a global/whole-project assessment (that is `/speckit.review`'s job). Entries are `scope: local`.
4. **Dedup guard.** Use a stable `run_id`; if a parent flow already recorded feedback for this same `(unit_id, run_id)`, the engine no-ops.
5. **Persist** via the engine:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
     --unit-id "skill:memory-recall" --unit-type skill \
     --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
     --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
   ```
   Probe attribution: the engine resolves the unit to its probe object automatically — the entry inherits kind/slice from the probe registry. External custom units record via `--unit-id custom:<owner>/<name> --unit-type custom-unit`; their entries stay host-project-local and never enter upstream packages.
6. **Consolidated submission prompt.** If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface a single consolidated prompt inviting the user to submit collected feedback to the Spec Kit developers; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`. Below threshold, do not prompt.

**Abort / partial-run rule.** If the run failed before wrap-up, either skip recording or record with `--partial` and a `## Review` beginning `**Partial run** — `.
