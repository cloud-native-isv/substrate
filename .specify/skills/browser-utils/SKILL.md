# Browser Utilities

## Overview

General-purpose browser automation skill with a **three-tier strategy** that adapts
to the executing agent's capabilities. The skill detects which tier applies and
routes to the appropriate automation approach.

- **Tier 1 — Built-in Browser**: Agents with embedded browser components (e.g., Wukong/Real) operate the browser directly through their native tools.
- **Tier 2 — MCP Connector + Chrome Extension**: Agents with `browser-use` MCP access (e.g., QoderWork, Qoder) control the desktop Chrome browser through MCP tool calls.
- **Tier 3 — Playwright Headless**: All other agents (Claude Code, Copilot, opencode, etc.) use Playwright to drive a headless or visible Chromium browser via scripts.

## Strategy Selection

**Execute this decision tree BEFORE any browser automation work.**

```
Step 1: Identify your agent type
    |-- Agent has built-in browser tools (navigate, click, screenshot as native tools)
    |   --> TIER 1: Use built-in browser tools directly
    |
    |-- Agent has browser-use MCP server available (navigate_page, take_snapshot, click, etc.)
    |   --> TIER 2: Use MCP connector (see § Tier 2 below)
    |
    |-- All other agents (Claude Code, Copilot, opencode, Codex, Hermes, etc.)
    |   --> TIER 3: Use Playwright headless automation (see § Tier 3 below)
```

### Agent Type Detection Signals

| Tier | Detection Signal | Examples |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | System prompt mentions built-in browser capabilities; agent has native `navigate`/`click`/`screenshot` tools without requiring MCP or scripts | Wukong (悟空), Real |
| **Tier 2** | `browser-use` MCP server is available; tools like `navigate_page`, `take_snapshot`, `click`, `fill` are present in the tool list | QoderWork, Qoder IDE |
| **Tier 3** | No built-in browser, no `browser-use` MCP; agent has `Bash`/`Write`/`Read` tools only | Claude Code, Copilot, opencode, Codex, Hermes |

> **If you cannot determine your agent type, default to Tier 3 (Playwright).**

---

## Tier 1: Built-in Browser

When the executing agent has a built-in browser component, use its native browser
tools directly. No MCP calls, no script files, no Playwright setup needed.

**How to use**: Call the agent's native browser tools (e.g., `navigate`, `click`,
`screenshot`, `get_text`) as you would any other agent tool. The browser session
is managed by the agent runtime.

**Key advantages**:
- Zero setup — browser is already available
- Full session persistence — cookies, localStorage, and auth state carry over
- Real browser rendering — no headless emulation gaps

**Constraints**:
- Tool availability depends on the agent runtime; check which tools are actually exposed
- Some agents may not expose `evaluate_script` or network inspection

---

## Tier 2: MCP Connector (browser-use)

When the agent has access to the `browser-use` MCP server, control the desktop
Chrome browser through MCP tool calls. No script files needed.

**Core workflow**: Navigate → `take_snapshot` → act on elements by `uid` → verify.

**Available tools** (16 total): `navigate_page`, `take_snapshot`, `take_screenshot`,
`click`, `fill`, `press_key`, `hover`, `drag`, `upload_file`, `handle_dialog`,
`wait_for`, `evaluate_script`, `list_pages`, `select_page`, `list_network_requests`,
`list_console_messages`.

For the complete tool reference, operation patterns, and best practices, see
[references/mcp-browser-tools.md](./references/mcp-browser-tools.md).

**Key advantages**:
- Operates the user's real desktop Chrome — full extension and profile support
- Interactive — no script files to write and manage
- a11y tree snapshots provide structured element identification

**Constraints**:
- Requires Chrome with the browser-use extension to be running
- Snapshot uids are ephemeral — always snapshot before acting
- No persistent sessions across MCP server restarts

---

## Tier 3: Playwright Headless Automation

When neither Tier 1 nor Tier 2 is available, use Playwright to drive a Chromium
browser via JavaScript or Python scripts.

### Run Mode Selection (choose FIRST, before writing any script)

Tier 3 has **two mutually exclusive run modes**. Decide which one applies before
writing code — they use different browser binaries and launch options, and picking
the wrong one silently fails (e.g. a real logged-in site redirects to its login page).

| | **Mode 1 — Clean Test Browser** | **Mode 2 — Real Chrome Profile** |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Frontend/localhost automation & E2E testing | Reach sites that need an existing login state |
| Browser | Playwright's bundled Chromium / Chrome for Testing | Real Google Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`) |
| Launch | `chromium.launch()` (fresh ephemeral context) | `chromium.launchPersistentContext(userDataDir, …)` |
| Keychain | Default `--use-mock-keychain` (kept) | `ignoreDefaultArgs: ['--use-mock-keychain']` (real keychain) |
| Login state | None (clean slate each run) | Reuses cookies/localStorage from the profile |

**Selection rule** (apply in order):
1. Target is `localhost`/a dev server, or the task is testing the user's own frontend → **Mode 1** (default).
2. Task needs an authenticated/internal site, OR the user supplies a Chrome `userDataDir`/profile → **Mode 2**.
3. If it is ambiguous whether login state is required, **ask the user to confirm the mode before launching** (see Strict Requirement #3).

Mode 2 has strict preconditions (profile must not be in use; real Chrome; real
keychain). For the full launch recipe, preflight checks, and failure-symptom table,
see [references/playwright-patterns.md § Run Modes (Tier 3)](./references/playwright-patterns.md#run-modes-tier-3).

**JavaScript path**: Write Playwright scripts to `/tmp`, execute via the universal
runner `${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/js/run.js`.

**Python path**: Use `sync_playwright` with `${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/python/with_server.py`
for server lifecycle management.

For code examples, patterns, and helper usage, see
[references/playwright-patterns.md](./references/playwright-patterns.md).

For the complete Playwright API reference, see
[references/playwright-api.md](./references/playwright-api.md).

### Setup

**JavaScript** (one-time):
```bash
cd ${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/js && npm run setup
```

Before the first script of a session, verify the install actually **loads** (a
partial/corrupt `node_modules` passes `install` but throws `Cannot find module
'./lib/bootstrap'` at runtime). This one-liner self-repairs:
```bash
cd ${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/js && node -e "require('playwright'); console.log('playwright OK')" \
  || { rm -rf node_modules/playwright* && npm install; }
```
See [references/playwright-patterns.md § Preflight: verify the Playwright install](./references/playwright-patterns.md#preflight-verify-the-playwright-install-actually-resolves).

**Python** (one-time):
```bash
pip install playwright && playwright install chromium
```

### JavaScript Workflow

1. **Auto-detect dev servers** (for localhost testing):
   ```bash
   cd ${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/js && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(s => console.log(JSON.stringify(s)))"
   ```
   - 1 server → use it automatically
   - Multiple → ask user which one
   - None → ask for URL or help start dev server

2. **Write script to `/tmp`** — never write to skill or project directory

3. **Execute via runner**:
   ```bash
   cd ${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/js && node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-*.js
   ```

### Python Workflow

1. **Check if server is running** — if not, use `with_server.py`:
   ```bash
   python ${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/python/with_server.py --help
   ```

2. **Write Playwright script** with only automation logic (server managed by helper)

3. **Execute**:
   ```bash
   python ${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/python/with_server.py --server "npm run dev" --port 5173 -- python your_script.py
   ```

Python examples, see [references/playwright-patterns.md](./references/playwright-patterns.md).

## Strict Requirements

1. **Detect agent type FIRST** — always run the Strategy Selection decision tree before any browser work
2. **Tier 3: Select run mode FIRST** — before writing any script, decide Mode 1 (clean test browser) vs Mode 2 (real Chrome profile) per § Run Mode Selection. The two modes use different binaries and launch options; picking wrong fails silently.
3. **Tier 3: Confirm the mode when login state is ambiguous** — if it is unclear whether the target needs an existing login, or the user references a Chrome profile/`userDataDir`, ask the user to confirm Mode 2 (and which profile) before launching a real profile.
4. **Tier 3 Mode 2: Preflight and release the profile** — the target `userDataDir` must have no running Chrome (singleton lock) or launch is silently handed off to the existing window and exits ("正在现有的浏览器会话中打开"). Verify no process holds the profile before launching; if one does, ask the user to close it. Always close the context in a `finally` block so the singleton lock is released for the next run and the user's own Chrome.
5. **Tier 3: Detect servers FIRST** — for localhost testing (Mode 1), always run `detectDevServers()` before writing test code
6. **Write scripts to `/tmp`** — never write test files to the skill directory or user's project (`/tmp/playwright-test-*.js`)
7. **Parameterize URLs** — put detected/provided URL in a `TARGET_URL` constant at the top of every script
8. **Visible browser by default (Tier 3)** — use `headless: false` unless user explicitly requests headless mode
9. **Tier 2: Always snapshot before acting** — uids from stale snapshots are invalid after page changes
10. **Wait strategies over fixed timeouts** — use `waitForSelector`, `waitForURL`, `waitForLoadState` (Tier 3) or `wait_for` (Tier 2) instead of arbitrary sleeps
11. **Error handling** — always use try-catch for robust automation; screenshot on error for debugging
12. **Tier 3 SPA traversal: settle dynamic content, prove login, screenshot every module** — before extracting a module, wait for lazy content (Grafana panels / tab bodies / expandable rows) to actually render — never extract an empty "(0 panels)" shell; count real panel ELEMENTS as the authoritative panel count (a framework's own "(N panels)" row-header label is a collapsed-state artifact — do not surface it) and scope panel/field titles to the header node so table/stat bodies are not swallowed; assert the first navigation did NOT land on a login page (fail fast) and record a run log; capture a per-module screenshot and a one-line PURPOSE, treating a failed screenshot as a recorded problem, not a silent skip. See [references/playwright-patterns.md § SPA Site Traversal & Module Extraction](./references/playwright-patterns.md#spa-site-traversal--module-extraction-tier-3)

## Conventions

- **Tier preference**: Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3 — always use the highest available tier
- **Inline vs files (Tier 3)**: Inline for quick one-off tasks (screenshot, check element); files for complex tests
- **slowMo (Tier 3)**: Use `slowMo: 100` to make actions visible and easier to follow
- **Custom headers (Tier 3)**: Use `PW_HEADER_NAME`/`PW_HEADER_VALUE` env vars to identify automated traffic
- **Console output**: Use `console.log()` (JS) or `print()` (Python) to track progress
- **Full-site enumeration (Tier 3)**: To map every module of an SPA (left-nav + hash routes) into a design doc, use one reused context, resumable checkpoints, and per-module extraction — see [references/playwright-patterns.md § SPA Site Traversal & Module Extraction](./references/playwright-patterns.md#spa-site-traversal--module-extraction-tier-3)

## Path Conventions

This Skill follows the canonical path conventions:

- Use `${SKILL_HOME}/<relative-path>` for every Skill-owned resource reference.
- Use `${SKILL_WORKDIR}/<relative-path>` for every runtime/user-facing path.
- Never embed agent-specific install paths.

## Resources

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/js/` | `run.js` universal executor, `package.json`, `lib/helpers.js` |
| `${SKILL_HOME}/scripts/python/` | `with_server.py` server lifecycle manager |
| `${SKILL_HOME}/references/` | `playwright-api.md`, `playwright-patterns.md`, `mcp-browser-tools.md`, `claude-code-guide.md`, `copilot-guide.md`, `qoder-guide.md` |
| `${SKILL_HOME}/examples/` | Python example scripts (element discovery, static HTML, console logging) |

## Dependencies

- **Tier 1**: Agent's built-in browser (no external dependencies)
- **Tier 2**: `browser-use` MCP server + Chrome with browser-use extension
- **Tier 3 JavaScript**: Node.js (>=14.0.0), Playwright npm package (`^1.57.0`), Chromium browser
- **Tier 3 Python**: Python (>=3.8), `playwright` Python package, Chromium browser

## Agent-Specific Configuration

### Step 1: Identify Executing Agent

Before executing this skill's workflow, identify which AI agent you are:

| Agent | Detection Signals |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | System prompt contains "Claude Code"; tools include `Agent`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `Read`; `.claude/` directory exists |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Running in VS Code Copilot Chat context; `.github/copilot-instructions.md` loaded; tools include `workspace edit`, `@terminal` |
| **Qoder CLI** | `.qoder/` directory exists; `AGENTS.md` instructions loaded |
| **opencode** | `.opencode/` directory exists |
| **Codex CLI** | `.codex/` directory exists |
| **Hermes Agent** | `.hermes/` directory exists |

If you cannot identify your agent, skip Step 2 and proceed with the standard workflow.

### Step 2: Load Agent-Specific Guidance

If you identified your agent in Step 1, check if a guide exists at:

```
${SKILL_HOME}/references/<agent-slug>-guide.md
```

Where `<agent-slug>` is: `claude-code`, `copilot`, `qoder`, `opencode`, `codex`, `hermes`.

If the guide exists, read it and apply the agent-specific tool mappings, best practices, and pitfall avoidances during execution. If no guide exists for your agent, proceed with the standard workflow.

### Step 3: Capture Execution Feedback

If you encounter an agent-specific obstacle during execution (e.g., a tool call is unavailable, output format doesn't match expectations, a workaround was needed), generate a feedback document at:

```
.specify/memory/feedback/browser-utils-<agent-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>.md
```

The feedback document MUST contain:

```markdown
# Agent Execution Feedback

**Source**: browser-utils
**Agent**: <agent-slug>
**Timestamp**: <ISO-8601>
**Outcome**: <success-with-workaround | partial-failure | full-failure>

## Obstacle
[Description of the agent-specific issue encountered]

## Workaround Applied
[What was done to work around the issue, if anything]

## Suggested Improvement
[Specific change to the skill or reference document that would prevent this issue]
```

Only generate feedback when a genuine agent-specific obstacle was encountered.

## Feedback

**Runtime-mode gate.** If `${SKILL_WORKDIR}/.specify/` does not exist, this skill is
running in standalone mode (a non–Spec Kit deployment, e.g. a global agent skills
directory) — skip this entire Feedback step: no engine call, no feedback entry.

At the end of a substantial run of this skill, perform an agent self-reflection step (never solicit feedback content from the user), following the canonical convention in `.specify/shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`:

1. **Gate on qualification & completion.** Only proceed if this run reached a meaningful wrap-up. Skip trivial/no-op runs; for an aborted run use the abort/partial rule below.
2. **Reflect (no user input).** Review this run against this skill's declared purpose and produce a short review plus ≥1 concrete, skill-specific optimization point. If the run was clean, use exactly: `No significant optimization points identified this run.`
3. **Scope guard.** Keep strictly to this skill's operation; do NOT produce a global/whole-project assessment (that is `/speckit.review`'s job). Entries are `scope: local`.
4. **Dedup guard.** Use a stable `run_id`; if a parent flow already recorded feedback for this same `(unit_id, run_id)`, the engine no-ops.
5. **Persist** via the engine:
   ```bash
   python3 "${SKILL_WORKDIR:-.}/.specify/scripts/python/feedback-utils.py" --action record \
     --unit-id "skill:browser-utils" --unit-type skill \
     --run-id "<stable-run-id>" --feature "<feature-key-if-any>" \
     --review "<review prose>" --points-file "<points file>"
   ```
   Probe attribution: the engine resolves the unit to its probe object automatically — the entry inherits kind/slice from the probe registry. External custom units record via `--unit-id custom:<owner>/<name> --unit-type custom-unit`; their entries stay host-project-local and never enter upstream packages.
6. **Consolidated submission prompt.** If the returned `should_prompt` is `true`, surface a single consolidated prompt inviting the user to submit collected feedback to the Spec Kit developers; on confirmation run `--action mark-submitted`. Below threshold, do not prompt.

**Abort / partial-run rule.** If the run failed before wrap-up, either skip recording or record with `--partial` and a `## Review` beginning `**Partial run** — `.
