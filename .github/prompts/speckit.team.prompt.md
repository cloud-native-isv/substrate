$ARGUMENTS
```

Process `$ARGUMENTS` per the [User Input Protocol](.specify/shared/workflow/user-input-protocol.md). If empty, execute the **Default Behavior (No Arguments)** defined below. If non-empty but intent is ambiguous or unsupported, report capabilities and request the missing intent (do NOT guess silently).

## Outline

`/speckit.team` is the **single entry point** for every **team** operation — the multi-agent analogue of `/speckit.agents`. It recognizes intent, then routes to the owning team skill. It delegates to skills and does **NOT** render templates inline. It MUST NOT serve single-agent authoring (that is `/speckit.agents`), and single-agent commands MUST NOT serve team operations.

A **team** is a named, reusable multi-agent structure organized around a single **goal**. Every team has three parts: a **goal** (the team's overall final objective — the north star that all work serves), a **static structure** (Role × Stage × Type roster — *who* participates), and a **dynamic structure** (collaboration pattern — parallel / serial / iteration / continuous — with its parallelism/DAG/iteration/operating settings and execution flow — *how* they collaborate). The four patterns each encode a priority: **parallel** = 效率优先 (throughput), **serial** = 质量优先 (quality, verified handoffs), **iteration** = 目标收敛 (converge then stop), **continuous** = 长期运营 (operate on a cadence). The static and dynamic structures exist **only to achieve the goal**; whatever they are, they MUST be organized and run around it. Persistent teams own a directory at the canonical location `.specify/teams/<slug>/` (definition at `.specify/teams/<slug>/team.md`; run reports under `.specify/teams/<slug>/runs/`). The multi-agent Conceptual Model that underpins teams is defined once in `skills/create-team/references/conceptual-model.md`; the `continuous` operating discipline in `skills/create-team/references/operating-loops.md`.

### Goal — 团队的最终目标

Every team MUST have a **goal** set at creation and carried for its whole lifetime. The goal is the team's single overall final objective — the reason the team exists — and it governs both structures below.

- **North star, not a task list.** The goal states the desired end outcome, not the steps. The static structure (roster) and dynamic structure (pattern) are both *derived from* and *subordinate to* the goal: the goal decides which roles/stages are needed and which collaboration pattern fits. The Goal concept itself — project-level definition, criteria authority, singularity, and the `goal_slug` Goal–Team binding — is defined once in `.specify/shared/definitions/goal-definitions.md`.
- **Concrete and verifiable.** State the goal so progress toward it can be judged — ideally with explicit success criteria / quality dimensions and, where possible, a measurable target (e.g. a score threshold, a passing test suite, a coverage bar). The **evaluator** stage and the **iteration/continuous** `threshold` / quality dimensions measure progress *against the goal*; a goal that cannot be evaluated cannot drive a loop.
- **Distinct from `description`.** `description` is a one-line label; the **goal** is the operational objective the whole team is organized around. A team has exactly **one** goal (sub-objectives belong to member roles/stages).
- **Deliberately revisable, never drifting.** The goal stays fixed while a team runs and never changes as a *side effect* of restructuring — but it is not frozen. The **modify** mode can deliberately **redefine an existing team's goal**; when it does, the static and dynamic structures MUST be re-checked and realigned to serve the new goal.

When a goal's theme is **optimization**, `create-team` further classifies it (**one-time vs continuous**) and, for continuous optimization, selects a strategy (**elimination vs progressive**) — see `skills/create-team/references/optimization-goals.md`.

The goal is persisted as the `goal` frontmatter field and rendered as a `## Goal` section (see Persistence).

### Modes → Capability Routing

`/speckit.team` exposes **exactly three modes**:

| Mode | Recognized intent | Delegates to skill |
|------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **create** | "创建团队", "组织一个团队", "组建团队", "new team", "build a team" | `create-team` |
| **modify** | "修改团队", "调整团队", "优化 team", "improve/adjust team" | `improve-team` |
| **run** | "运行团队", "执行团队", "run/execute team", "跑一遍" | `create-team` (execution path) |

**Routing flow**:

1. **Recognize intent** from `$ARGUMENTS` and conversation/repo context: classify as `create`, `modify`, or `run`.
2. **create** → `create-team`: **first establish the goal** — elicit it from `$ARGUMENTS` / conversation / repo context, or ask for it, and confirm it with the user — then **match the goal against the predefined team presets** (`skills/create-team/templates/teams/`, matched via `skills/create-team/scripts/match-team-preset.py`): on a strong match, recommend reusing that preset instead of deriving a team from scratch; otherwise propose a roster (static structure) + pattern config (dynamic structure) **derived from that goal**. On confirmation persist `.specify/teams/<slug>/team.md` (or run one-shot without persisting).
3. **modify** → `improve-team`: load the existing team and apply targeted, evidence-based edits to any of its three parts — the **goal**, the **static structure**, or the **dynamic structure**. Structure edits are structure-preserving and keep serving the current goal. **Redefining the goal is a first-class, supported edit**: when the goal changes, re-evaluate and realign the roster and pattern to serve the new goal. Re-persist and bump `updated`.
4. **run** → `create-team` execution path: follow the **preview → confirm → execute** gate below.
5. **Empty arguments** → execute **Default Behavior (No Arguments)** below.
6. **Non-empty but ambiguous / unsupported** → report capabilities and request the missing intent (see "Ambiguous or Unsupported Intent" below).
7. **modify / run targeting a team that does not exist** under `.specify/teams/` → report **"team not found"** and offer to `create` it.

### Default Behavior (No Arguments)

When `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, the command MUST execute the following sequence instead of routing to a mode:

1. **List all existing teams** — scan `.specify/teams/*/team.md` and present a summary table with each team's `slug`, `name`, `goal`, and `pattern`. If no teams exist, state "No teams found" explicitly.
2. **Give contextual suggestions** — based on the current conversation, recent repo activity, and the listed teams, recommend the most relevant next action. Examples:
   - A team whose goal aligns with the current task → suggest `run <slug>`.
   - A team whose structure seems outdated relative to recent changes → suggest `modify <slug>`.
   - No teams exist or no team fits the current need → suggest `create` with a proposed goal derived from context.
   Suggestions MUST be grounded in observable context (conversation history, repo state, team definitions), NOT fabricated.
3. **Show capability summary** — briefly list the three modes (create / modify / run) so the user knows what operations are available.

This behavior is informational and non-destructive: it MUST NOT create, modify, or run any team without explicit user instruction.

### Ambiguous or Unsupported Intent

When intent cannot be resolved from non-empty arguments, the command MUST report the recognized capabilities and request the missing intent. It MUST NOT guess silently or fail without a message. Report this capability listing:

- **create** — establish the team's **goal**, then author a new team (static + dynamic structure) organized around it and persist it → `create-team`
- **modify** — adjust/optimize an existing team — reshape its structure, or **redefine its goal** and realign the structure to the new goal → `improve-team`
- **run** — restate the **goal**, render the team's structure, and execute it after confirmation → `create-team`

### Run Mode (preview → confirm → execute)

The **run** mode MUST follow this sequence and MUST NOT execute before confirmation:

1. **Load** the target team from `.specify/teams/<slug>/team.md`.
2. **Restate the Goal** — surface the team's `goal` up front, so both structures below are read as *means to that end* and execution can be judged against it.
3. **Render Static Structure** — the roster as a Role × Stage × Type matrix: each member agent, its role, its type (Worker/Meta), and its lifecycle (persistent/temporary).
4. **Render Dynamic Structure** —
   - the collaboration `pattern` (parallel / serial / iteration / continuous);
   - the **parallelism** (parallel: degree + territories; serial: DAG stage order + per-handoff verification; iteration: threshold, max_iterations, regression_limit, quality dimensions; continuous: maturity level, cadence, budget, constraints, independent verifier, state spine);
   - an **execution flow diagram** (textual / mermaid / PlantUML flow showing dispatch / handoff / loop edges).
5. **Confirmation gate** — present the **goal** and both structures, and ask the user to confirm. The team executes **only** on explicit confirmation.
   - **Disclose the summary decision** before confirming, so its cost is known at decision time: whether this run will refresh the goal summary or not and — when it will not — which gate suppresses it (budget / cadence / no material); the resolved **goal identity** and whether it is explicit (`goal_slug` declared) or inferred (falling back to the team slug); and the **target delivery directory** `.specify/goal/<goal-slug>/summary/`. See `skills/create-team/SKILL.md` → Summary Refresh (all patterns).
   - On confirm → orchestrate per the team's pattern (delegating to `create-team`'s execution engine): territory validation before parallel dispatch, DAG (no-cycle) validation + per-handoff verification before serial chain, mandatory max-iteration cap for iteration loops, and — for **continuous** loops — read `constraints.md` + budget + kill-switch at cycle start, run exactly **one cycle** at the team's declared maturity level (starting at L1), with an independent verifier at L2+; file-path-only handoff throughout. Per-member dispatch modality (native / virtual / external) follows `.specify/shared/definitions/subagent-definitions.md`; external CLI dispatch MUST honor its Visibility Contract (stream-json + progress filter + `.live.log`/`.jsonl`/`.status` triplet — silent `cli -p … > log 2>&1` dispatch is prohibited). Work is steered toward the **goal**, and the evaluator measures progress against it (iteration: iterate until the goal's threshold is met or the cap is reached; continuous: run one cycle, then update the state spine and stop).
   - On decline → stop without executing; optionally suggest `modify`.
6. **Report** — after execution finishes, write a dated run report to `.specify/teams/<slug>/runs/<UTC-timestamp>-report.md` (goal, execution time, result summary, full process detail). Mandatory for every run.

**Output discipline** (see `skills/create-team/SKILL.md` → Run Workspace, Reports & Output Discipline): all run **intermediates** stay in the git-ignored workspace `.specify/teams/.work/<slug>/`; **deliverables** (standard output) go only to their declared target paths; the team directory `.specify/teams/<slug>/` holds **only** the team's tracked run information (`team.md`, `runs/`, `items.jsonl`, plus `constraints.md` / `STATE.md` / `run-log.jsonl` for continuous teams). The periodic **summary** is a derived product indexed by *goal*, not by team: it lands in `.specify/goal/<goal-slug>/summary/` and never in the team directory.

### Persistence

- Canonical store: the team **directory** `.specify/teams/<slug>/` — definition at `.specify/teams/<slug>/team.md`, accumulating run reports under `.specify/teams/<slug>/runs/`. No per-tool symlink — teams are a framework-internal concept. Run intermediates live in the git-ignored `.specify/teams/.work/<slug>/`, never in the team directory.
- Each persisted team carries frontmatter (`slug`, `name`, `description`, `goal`, `pattern`, `members`, `config`, `created`, `updated`), a `## Goal` section (the team's overall final objective + success criteria), a `## Static Structure` section, and a `## Dynamic Structure` section (see `skills/create-team/SKILL.md` and the data model). The `## Goal` section is authored first — the static and dynamic sections are organized to serve it.

## Handoffs

**Before**: Optional `/speckit.agents` to author or refine the single agents that will become team members.

**After**: Run `/speckit.instructions` to sync discoverability of newly created teams and team skills.
